**Lower Side Button B**.

## Installation & Usage
**For Debian-based users:**
- Download the deb from the [release page](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/Instant-A704F-Mouse-Utilities/releases/latest) and install it.

**For other distribution:**
Sorry I do not know how to or I am too lazy to package.

0. Make sure you have Qt 6 installed. (If you are running KDE Plasma 6.x then you already have Qt 6)
1. Download the binary from the [release page](https://github.com/Kenny-Hui/Instant-A704F-Mouse-Utilities/releases/latest)
2. Put it in an safe location
3. Run it!

**Note:**
The **Side Button A** and **Side Button B** is intentionally named ambigiously as their meaning may not be the same on some mouse models (A means forward button and B means backward button, however some mouse model have it the other way around). You will have to do some basic testing to figure that out for your own mouse.

### Flags
`--apply` - Apply settings to the mouse unattendedly without launching a GUI (As the mouse does not store settings persistently)  
`--daemon` - Start a background daemon, this is required to handle key input functionalities.

A common setup is to add an autostart entry with the program argument `--apply --daemon` so that it applies the mouse settings on startup and run persistently in the background.
